# Best and Worst Cases

## Bubble Sort

### Best: Ascending order
* Since the list of n elements is already sorted in ascending order, there will be no swaps as we go through n-1 passes. 
* The runtime complexity is 1. 
### Worst: Descending order
* 

## Selection Sort
### Best and Worst: None
* There is always only one swap per pass. This is because when the elements are swapped, one of the elements is being put in its correct position. 
* The runtime complexity is n 

## Insertion Sort
### Best: Ascending order

### Worst: Descending order
